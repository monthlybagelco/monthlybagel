# monthlybagel
The Monthly Bagel is a news site created by LAMS students RR Strauss, LB Dare, and S Westcott, as well as a team of volunteers helping us produce news monthly. The Monthly Bagel is focused on elegance, design, and simplicity of use. It has a simple, easy-to-navigate UI, while looking beautiful at the same time.

The Monthly Bagel mainly features science/math/technology news, but what our readers suggest is most important. So if you would like us to feature another topic, just tell us!
